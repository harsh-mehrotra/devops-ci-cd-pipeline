Node.js CI/CD Pipeline Project
This project demonstrates a streamlined CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application, built from the ground up to showcase automated deployment using GitHub Actions and PM2 on a Linux VPS. It’s a practical example of how I set up a production-ready workflow for deploying web apps efficiently.
What's Inside?

Node.js with Express.js for the core application
GitHub Actions to automate the CI/CD process
PM2 to manage the Node.js app in production
SSH for secure deployment to a VPS
Ubuntu VPS as the deployment target

How the Pipeline Works
When code is pushed to the main branch:

GitHub Actions triggers the workflow.
The app is built, tested, and zipped.
The zipped files are securely transferred to the VPS via SCP.
SSH commands deploy the app and restart it with PM2 to ensure it’s running smoothly.

Setup Instructions
Here’s how to set this up on your own VPS:

Clone the Repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/node-cicd-project.git
cd node-cicd-project


Install Dependencies
npm install


Configure GitHub SecretsIn your GitHub repo, go to Settings > Secrets and Actions > New repository secret, and add:

VPS_HOST: Your VPS IP or hostname
VPS_USER: SSH user for your VPS
VPS_SSH_KEY: Private SSH key (no passphrase)


Push to MainCommit and push your changes to the main branch. GitHub Actions will handle the rest.


Example Workflow
The .github/workflows/deploy.yml file:

Checks out the code
Sets up Node.js
Installs dependencies with npm install
Zips the project
Transfers it to the VPS using SCP
Uses SSH to unzip and start/restart the app with PM2

Deployment
This project is ready to deploy to your own VPS. Just follow the setup steps, and the pipeline will handle deployment automatically. No public demo is live yet, but you can adapt this for your own server.
Ideas for Improvement
Here are some enhancements I’m considering:

Containerize with Docker for easier scaling
Add NGINX as a reverse proxy for better performance
Automate SSL certificates with Let’s Encrypt
Send deployment status notifications to Slack
Build a rollback mechanism for failed deployments

Contributing
I’d love feedback or contributions! Fork the repo, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Let’s make this project even better.
