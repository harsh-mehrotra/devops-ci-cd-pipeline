🚀 Node.js CI/CD Pipeline
This project showcases a robust CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application, built to demonstrate automated deployment using GitHub Actions and PM2 on a Linux VPS. It’s a practical, production-ready example of how I streamline web app deployments with modern DevOps practices.

🌟 Project Overview
This is a lightweight Express.js app with a fully automated CI/CD pipeline. It’s designed to be simple yet powerful, showing how to deploy code to a VPS seamlessly. Here’s what powers it:

Node.js (Express.js): Backend framework for the app
GitHub Actions: Automates the build and deployment process
PM2: Manages the app in production, ensuring uptime
SSH/SCP: Secures file transfers to the VPS
Ubuntu VPS: Hosts the deployed application

🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Flow
Pushing to the main branch triggers the magic:

Build: GitHub Actions checks out the code and installs dependencies.
Package: The app is zipped for efficient transfer.
Transfer: Files are sent to the VPS via SCP.
Deploy: SSH commands unzip the app and restart it with PM2 for zero-downtime updates.

🛠️ How to Set It Up
Get this running on your own VPS in a few steps:
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/node-cicd-project.git
cd node-cicd-project

2. Install Dependencies
npm install

3. Configure GitHub Secrets
In your GitHub repo (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions), add these secrets:

4. Push to Main
Commit and push to trigger the pipeline:
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy app"
git push origin main

🔍 Workflow Breakdown
The .github/workflows/deploy.yml file handles:

Checkout: Grabs the latest code
Node.js Setup: Configures the Node environment
Dependency Installation: Runs npm install
Packaging: Zips the project files
Transfer: Uses SCP to send files to the VPS
Deployment: SSH commands unzip and restart the app with PM2
